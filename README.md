## WordPress Video Revealer Form Plugin

* Client-side and server-side validation to ensure data integrity. 
* Nonce verification for enhanced form security. 
* Sanitization of input fields using sanitize functions. 
* Integrated v3 reCAPTCHA to prevent spam submissions. 
* Encrypted sensitive contact information stored in the database.
